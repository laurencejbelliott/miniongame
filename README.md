# The Minion Game
A text based word game which implements the game described in the hackerrank problem 'The Minion Game' @ "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-minion-game/problem".


A string is entered, and 2 players take turns to guess the possible substrings of this string.
Player 1 can only make guesses with the first character being a consonant (not including Y).
Player 2 can only make guesses with the first character being a vowel.
With the first guess of each correct substring, the player is awarded 1 point 
for each time the substring occurs in the original string. 

Once all the possible substrings have been guessed, the player with the most points wins.

Run the script in Windows cmd/ Linux terminal with the command 'python banana.py'.
